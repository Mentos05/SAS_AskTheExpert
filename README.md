# SAS Ask the Expert
Contents from my Ask the Expert Session about SAS + Open Source provided on March 11th 2021.

The examples in this repository are divided into 4 different areas:
1. Open Source Integration into SAS Model Studio Pipelines (Open Source Code Node)
2. General Python API for SAS Cloud Analytics Services (SAS SWAT)
3. Deep Learning Python API (SAS DLPy)
4. SAS Event Stream Processing Python API (SAS ESPPy)

Which way you go usually depends on your usecase and role.

Like the visual interface of SAS Model Studio but want to include Python-code? -> Open Source Node<br>
Familiar with Python but want to use the power of SAS Viya to analyze structured data? -> SAS SWAT<br>
Familiar with Python but want to use deep learning features of SAS Viya? -> SAS DLPy<br>
Familiar with Python but want to create streaming pipelines with SAS ESP? -> SAS ESPPy<br>
