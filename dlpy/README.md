Deep Learning is mainly used to analyze unstructured data like images, text, sound, etc.<br>
In this example I demonstrate how to train an object detection model with SAS DLPy to recognize objects at an airport.<br>
The demo is part of a bigger story about Airport Turnaround Management and can be found [here](https://github.com/Mentos05/SAS_DeepLearning/tree/master/Aircraft%20Turnaround%20Management).
