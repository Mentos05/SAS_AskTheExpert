SAS Event Stream Processing is perfect if you want to analyze streaming data, uncover hidden insights with AI and make real-time, intelligent decisions.<br>
In this example I demonstrate how to use a trained object detection model to anaylze video footage from an airport in real-time.<br>
The demo is part of a bigger story about Airport Turnaround Management and can be found [here](https://github.com/Mentos05/SAS_DeepLearning/tree/master/Aircraft%20Turnaround%20Management).
