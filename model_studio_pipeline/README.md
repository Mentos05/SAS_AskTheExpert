SAS Viya is perfect for analyzing large data and if you want to use a visual interface I highly recommend SAS Model Studio with its pipeline interface.<br>
In this example I demonstrate how to perform modelling on structured data with SAS Model Studio.<br>
The pipeline consists of a SAS Random Forest and a Python Random Forest. At the end we are comparing both models to find out which one is the champion.<br>
Our goal is to predict flight delays given historical flight data.<br>
