<br>
SAS Viya is perfect for analyzing large data and if you want to use familiar Python-syntax you should try SAS SWAT.<br>
In this example I demonstrate how to perform basic data loading, exploration and modelling on structured data with SAS SWAT.<br>
Our goal is to predict flight delays given historical flight data.<br>

### Official Repository
The official SAS SWAT repository with more examples can be found here:
* [SAS Scripting Wrapper for Analytics Transfer (SWAT)](https://github.com/sassoftware/python-swat)

### Further Ressources
There is a well written book called "SAS Viya: The Python Perspective" which I highly recommend.<br>
This book describes in 10 chapters everything you need to know about working with SAS SWAT.<br>
In their GitHub repository you'll find all the codes from their book for free.<br>
